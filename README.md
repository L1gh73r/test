### How to submit a plugin
1. Create a plugin and upload it to GitHub.

2. Create a ZIP file of your plugin folder and upload it as a release on GitHub.
   - for example, you can check out our plugin releases https://github.com/robiso/wondercms-plugins/releases
   
3. IMPORTANT: Make sure your ZIP file is created in a way so the user can simply unzip and upload it to their plugins folder. Test it with your built in WonderCMS plugins installer.

4. Notify us
   - via GitHub or the WonderCMS community https://www.wondercms.com/forum
